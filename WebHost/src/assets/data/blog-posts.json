            "content": "When I look at a picture of myself from when I was younger, I never look how I thought I looked. I see more beauty, and freedom then I thought I had at the time. What also streams back, is the thoughts and beliefs I had, at the time the picture was taken. There was a fragility in my thinking. The beauty in the picture is not only my appearance, but the presence and strength I was trying to have with my limited knowledge and experience in life, and didn't even know it at the time. \n\nI am reminded that my core spirit or soul...or what you may call it, still shines through. Looking at these photos of myself, is like watching a film that has been fast forward with still images, moving quickly and jerking at my emotions. Some images difficult and some joyful, and others full of regret. \nI have grown, cried, stood up, fallen down, and helped others. I've stretched and pulled at my soul, to fine polish it, so that it brighter for me and others to see. I have more wisdom and reassurance in who I am, and that I hope I have the courage to live more authentically, and know that I will continue to be beautiful in my own way. \n\nWhen I take a picture now, I will set an intention my <q>knowing<q> will comes through. Hope you recognize and hold on to your beauty, and let it shine everyday."

I settled into the play and for the moment, I new I would be transported into another story, and was hopeful for some creativity. \n\n The play started as normal, engaging and interesting. A few minutes into the play as the story is unfolding, the curtain rises, and there is a beautiful magical world that the audience is invited to physically stand up and walk into. I'm not sure what was more delightful the visual beauty of the set, or being invited to move into a new world of possibility, or the physical act of moving to something new. If had known, what was to unfold, would I of been so present to marvel in it's beauty? Would I have been so magically surprised?\n\n Now, when I reflect, on this situation, in comparison to my other experiences. I see that I let the story unfold. I gave it space to be what it would be, and was present, and open to what it might be. In doing so, I was truly surprised. I invite you to be open to moments of being truly surprised."
