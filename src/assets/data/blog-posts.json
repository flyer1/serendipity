            "content": "When I look at a picture of myself from when I was younger, I never look how I thought I looked. I see more beauty, and freedom then I thought I had at the time. What also streams back, is the thoughts and beliefs I had, at the time the picture was taken. There was a fragility in my thinking. The beauty in the picture is not only my appearance, but the presence and strength I was trying to have with my limited knowledge and experience in life, and didn't even know it at the time. \n\nI am reminded that my core spirit or soul...or what you may call it, still shines through. Looking at these photos of myself, is like watching a film that has been fast forward with still images, moving quickly and jerking at my emotions. Some images difficult and some joyful, and others full of regret. \nI have grown, cried, stood up, fallen down, and helped others. I've stretched and pulled at my soul, to fine polish it, so that it brighter for me and others to see. I have more wisdom and reassurance in who I am, and that I hope I have the courage to live more authentically, and know that I will continue to be beautiful in my own way. \n\nWhen I take a picture now, I will set an intention my <q>knowing<q> will comes through. Hope you recognize and hold on to your beauty, and let it shine everyday."
